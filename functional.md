# Tic Tac Toe

Introduction:  For my final project I made a tic tac toe game.  Online I saw lots of games using ggame and graphics, but I wanted to make a text based game.  I always understood that stuff more, and I wanted my game to be different from the other codes found online.

Access:  To access my program, the user will need to open http://runpython.com and then go to my github account where it will be under file name Final Project.

There are no graphics involved in this program.  Everything is texted based but by using a lot of dashes, "l's", and spaces, I was able to make a gameboard.  Its graphics using text.

The mouse does not do anything in this game.  The keys that mean anything are 'q', 'w', 'e', 'a', 's', 'd', 'z', 'x', and 'c'.  If you look down on your keyboard, those keys should look something like a box.  Each key is assigned to that area on the tic tac toe board.  On the keyboard, the keys won't make a perfect box as they are on a slight angle, but as most smaller keyboards don't include a seperate area for the numbers (which would be a perfect box), I thought using these keys would be the next best thing and make the game playable for more users.  

The user does not need to do anything to install the program other than getting the link from my github and putting it into runpython.
